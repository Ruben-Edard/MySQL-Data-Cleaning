Project Description

In this project, I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on a dataset using MySQL. EDA is used to gain insights into the data, spot anomalies, and test assumptions.

The primary goal was to explore and clean the dataset, perform summary statistics, and visualize the results to uncover patterns or trends.
