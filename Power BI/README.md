# Introduction

This project is a Power BI sales analysis dashboard that provides insights into sales performance, customer accounts, and product profitability. The dataset includes transactional sales data, product details, and customer account information, allowing for in-depth business intelligence reporting.

Using Power BI and Power Query, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to create interactive visualizations that help identify trends, measure profitability, and support business decision-making.

The dataset used in this analysis is available in my GitHub repository: [Plant DTS](https://github.com/Ruben-Eduard/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Power%20BI/Plant_DTS.xls)

# Background

The dataset contains transactional sales records, including information on accounts, products, pricing, and locations. By cleaning and structuring the data, this analysis helps answer key business questions such as:

    Which products generate the highest revenue?
    What are the trends in sales over time?
    How do sales vary by region or account?
    What is the cost-to-revenue ratio across different products?

# Tools Used

To conduct this analysis, the following tools and technologies were used:

    Microsoft Excel – Initial data exploration
    Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
    Power BI – Data modeling and visualization
