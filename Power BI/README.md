# Introduction

This project analyzes the sales performance and profitability metrics of a plant distribution company operating across multiple countries. Using Power BI, the analysis transforms raw sales data into actionable insights, helping stakeholders understand market trends, product performance, and geographical distribution of sales.

The dataset used in this analysis is available in my GitHub repository: [Plant DTS](https://github.com/Ruben-Eduard/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Power%20BI/Plant_DTS.xls)

# Background

Plant Co. operates internationally, selling various types of plants categorized as Indoor, Outdoor, and Landscape products. The company faces challenges in tracking performance across different markets and maintaining profitability targets. With operations spanning multiple countries and a diverse product portfolio, there's a critical need to understand sales patterns, identify underperforming markets, and optimize product mix.
    
    1. What are the year-to-date sales trends across different months?
    2. How do different product types (Indoor, Landscape, Outdoor) contribute to overall sales?
    3. Which countries are performing above or below expectations compared to the previous year?
    4. What is the overall gross profit margin, and how does it vary across accounts?
    5. How are total sales distributed geographically across different markets?

# Tools Used

To conduct this analysis, the following tools and technologies were used:

    Microsoft Excel – Initial data exploration
    Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation and DAX calculations
    Power BI – Data modeling and visualization


## Project Guide

Data model:
I import the CSV into PowerBI, clean the data, removing duplicates and change the data type of fields, where I link the tables together in the Model side tab:
